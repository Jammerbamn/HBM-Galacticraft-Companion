# HBM-Galacticraft-Companion
This mod is an attempt to make the "Galacticraft Legacy" and "HBM Nuclear Tech" mods more interdependent between eachother.

Currently the only thing this mod changes is the Galacticraft's Refinery input to take Kerosene from HBM.

HBM already had logic to take in the Galacticraft crude oil and convert it into HBM crude oil using the fluid boiler. This can then be used in the refinery and necessary steps to create HBM kerosene.
You are able to leave your world generation settings alone, although for the full experience. I would recommend turning off oil generation in Galaticraft. This can be found in: config/Galacticraft/core.cfg. The section is: "D:"Oil Generation Factor"". set it to 0.

The only mods this is compatible with is:
Galacticraft Legacy

and

HBM Nuclear Tech-Extended Edition
